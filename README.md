##  Key Projects

- **[Linux-CIS-Audit-Tool](https://github.com/nikhilkumar0102/Linux-cis-audit)** :
```
An automated, AI-enhanced tool for auditing the security posture of Debian-based Linux systems. It uses the CIS (Center for
Internet Security) Benchmark to provide a detailed score and color-coded results. For failed checks, it leverages Google's Gemini
API to generate expert explanations, offering deeper insight into risks and actionable recommendations for system hardening.
```

- **[Secure Chat App with End-to-End Encryption](https://github.com/nikhilkumar0102/Elevate_Labs-Cyber-Security-Internship/tree/main/Project2%20Chatapp)** : 
```
This ongoing project is a secure chat application built with Flask-SocketIO, featuring end-to-end encryption (E2EE) using
RSA and AES. It includes user authentication, chat rooms, private messaging, and encrypted SQLite logs. The project also
explores cybersecurity by providing a vulnerable version with an SQL injection flaw, a detector to log attacks, and a
secure login implementation.
```
- **[PassGenius: Interactive Password Tool](https://github.com/nikhilkumar0102/Elevate_Labs-Cyber-Security-Internship/tree/main/Project1%20Interactive%20Password%20Suite)**:
```
PassGenius is a Python-based CLI tool designed to enhance digital security. It offers advanced password strength analysis
with crack time estimates and breach checks via the Have I Been Pwned API, ensuring privacy. The tool generates strong,
memorable passwords by combining user keywords with random elements and creates context-aware wordlists for security testing.
It includes a concise security guide and features a polished, interactive UI built with Rich for a seamless terminal experience.
```
- **[NetScan Nmap Automation Tool](https://github.com/nikhilkumar0102/NetScan)** : 
```  
It is a Python-based CLI network scanning tool.It leverages Nmap for efficient host discovery, port scanning, service
enumeration, and vulnerability detection. Designed for network administrators and security professionals, it offers
both command-line and interactive modes with detailed reporting and scan history tracking.
```
- **[Advanced Network Scanning Techniques Via-Nmap](https://github.com/nikhilkumar0102/Advanced-Network-Scanning)** :
```
Advanced-Network-Scanning is a comprehensive toolkit showcasing sophisticated network reconnaissance methods with tools like
Nmap and Netdiscover. It includes techniques for stealth scanning, firewall evasion, OS fingerprinting, and automated report
generation, tailored for ethical hacking and penetration testing.
```

- **[Labs-Writeups](https://github.com/nikhilkumar0102/Cyber-Lab-Writeups)**:
```
Write-ups from cybersecurity labs, challenges, and Capture The Flag (CTF) events completed on platforms like TryHackMe,
CyberDefenders, and others. Each write-up details key concepts, tools utilized, step-by-step solutions, and lessons learned
from hands-on exercises spanning various cybersecurity domains.
